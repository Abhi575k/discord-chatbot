"What, Rick? What’s going on?"
It's the middle of the night. What are you talking about?
Ow! Ow! You're tugging me too hard!
"We gotta go, gotta get outta here, come on. Got a surprise for you Morty."
"Yeah, Rick... I-it's great. Is this the surprise?"
What?! A bomb?!
T-t-that's absolutely crazy!
Jessica? From my math class?
Ohh...
Whhhh-wha?
"No, you can't!  Jessica doesn't even know I exist! But—but, but forget about that, because you can't blow up humanity!"
"What are you talking about, Rick?"
I don't care about Jessica! Y-Yyyyyyyyyyou—
"That's it... that's it, Rick. I'm taking the wheel."
"I'm taking charge of this situation, buddy!  I'm put—I’m, I'm, I'm, I'm puttin’... I-I’m, I’m, I’m not gonna stand around like some sort of dumb... dumb person and just le-let you ruin the whole world!"
"Come on! What’s gotten into you? If you love Earth so much why don’t you marry it?  What are you, crazy? Alright, alright, Morty."
Alright. I'll-I'll land. I'll land. I'll land. I'll land the thing. I’ll land the thing. Big tough guy all of a sudden.
"Oh, thank god."
It was?
Dad?
"Oh my god, my parents are so loud, I want to die."
"Okay, with all due respect, Rick— what am I talking about? What respect is due? How is my son supposed to pass his classes if you keep dragging him off for high-concept Sci-Fi rigamarole?"
"Oh, geez, Frank. I don't know if a knife is necessary. I mean, you know, y-you kind of had things handled without it."
"Oh, geez, Rick. W-w-what'd you do to Frank?"
"I don't know, Rick. I can't leave school again."
"Aw, geez. Okay. I guess I can skip history. What about Frank? I mean, shouldn't you unfreeze him?"
"Hey, Tom! We know when we're losing him. WE CAN HEAR THE BEEPS!"
"Oh, man, Rick. What is this place?"
"Oh, man, Rick. I'm looking around this place, and I'm starting to work up some anxiety about this whole thing."
"All right, all right, calm down. Listen to me, Morty. I know that new situations can be intimidating. You're looking around, and it's all scary and different, but, you know, m-meeting them head on, charging right into them like a bull that's how we grow as people. I'm no stranger to scary situations. I deal with them all the time. Now, if you just stick with me, Morty, we're gonna be—"
"HOLY CRAP, MORTY RUN!!!"
"I never seen that thing before in my life. I don't even know what the hell it is! We got to get out of here, Morty! It's gonna kill us! We're gonna die! We're gonna die, Morty!"
"All right, Rick, look how much longer is this gonna be? Shouldn't I be back at school by now?"
"Yeah, Rick, I get it. We're surrounded by monsters. That's kind of the reason why I want to leave."
"Ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta. Morty, you see this?"
The mega trees?
"All right, all right. So, what's so special about these seeds, anyways?"
"You ask a lot of questions, Morty. Not very charismatic. It makes you kind of an  under-  underfoot figure."
AAAAAAAHHHH!!!!!!
"Hello? Mrs. Smith? This is Principal Vagina, no relation. I wonder if you and Morty's father might be able to have a chat with me this afternoon?"
"I'm in a lot of pain, Rick!"
"Are you kidding me?! That's it, Rick! That's the last straw! I can't believe this! I'm sitting here with both of my legs broken, and you're still asking me about getting those seeds?! Ooh! Ow! Oh! Y-y-you're a monster. Y-you're like Hitler, but-but even Hitler cared about Germany or something."
"Ooh, Ohh, Ooh. Wow, Rick. That stuff just healed my broken legs instantly. I mean, I've never felt so good in my life. Thank you."
"Sure thing, Rick."
"Wow, that's pretty crazy, Rick."
What?!
"Oh, geez, Rick, that's not good. W-what are we gonna do? I-I have to be back at school right now. How are we gonna get back home?"
Uh-oh.
In my butt?
"Oh, geez, Rick. I really don't want to have to do that."
Uuuh.
In my butt?
The glarp zone is for flarping and unglarping only.
"Yeah, Rick. Let's just get this over with, okay? I mean, these things are pointy. They hurt."
"That means they're good ones. You're a good kid, Morty. Those mega seeds are super valuable to my work. You've been a huge help to me. I'm gonna be able to do a-"
Why does he have to go over there?
What new-  what new machine?
Aaaaah!
Don't think about it!
Whoooooo!
"Oh, man. I mean, you know, I-I don't want to shoot nobody."
"They're not robots, Rick!"
Holy crap! This is insane!
Yeah.
"I'm an angry father, not an improviser."
"Oh, hi, Jerry. Oh, my goodness, Morty! What are you doing out of class? We talked about this. Your-your parents and I are very disappointed in-in this behavior... No? No takers?"
You're beyond our reasoning!
"Dad, how could you make my son miss an entire semester of school? I mean, it's not like he's a hot girl. He can't just bail on his life and set up shop in someone else's."
We're moving you to a nursing home.
"Morty, stay out of this. You are obviously not capable of judging these situations on your own."
"Oh, don't high-road us, dad. You know fully well that Morty is the last child that needs to be missing classes."
"Aw, geez, dad. Y-you know, that's a lot to drop on a kid all at once."
"Oh, come on, Rick. You know I can't."
Holy crap. He's right.
But—
"No, I-I understand. Uh, maybe we overreacted. But he has to keep going to school."
Frank Palicky was frozen to death today!
"Holy cow, Rick. I didn't know hanging out with you was making me smarter."
"Aw, man."
"Ohh, man.  Oh, geez! Ohh."
"Don't praise him now, Morty! He just peed on the carpet! Bad dog! Bad!"
"Hey, wait, hold on a second, Rick. You wouldn't by any chance have some sort of crazy science thing you could whip up that might help make this dog a little smarter, would you?"
"Aw, man!"
"Boy, you really got me up against a wall this time, Jerry."
Snuffles.
"Snuffles, shake."
Roll over.
No way.
"That was fantastic, Rick!"
W-w-w-what is it?
"You talking about ""Inception""?"
"""Inception"" made sense."
"Geez, Rick, in the time it took you to make this thing, couldn't you have just, you know, helped me with my homework?"
"Are you listening to me, Morty? Homework is stupid. The whole point is to get less of it."
You don't know me!
Uh-oh! Spoilers!
"Wow, Rick, I can't believe we're sitting around, standing around in Mr. Goldenfold's house. It's really weird."
"Oh, I think you've had enough, sir."
You better stop with that.
Allahu  akbar! We're gonna take control of this plane! We're gonna 9/11 it unless Morty Smith gets better grades in math!
The name's not buddy. It's Goldenfold. Nice to wheat you!
Ooohhh!
What?! Are you kidding me?! Ohhhhhh!
Hmm?
"Goldenfold, we're coming out! We just want to talk!"
Mrs. Pancakes! AAAAAAAAHHHH!!!!!
"Oh, no, Morty. His subconscious is panicking."
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!
"Oh, no, Rick, look! Goldenfold landed the plane, and he's created a  mechanical arm to pluck Mrs. Pancakes out of the air while he lets us fall - into a giant vat of lava!"
You don't know m-
"Oh, man, Rick, this is pretty weird."
"Okay. All right, well Look, Mrs. Pancakes is right over there. I'll just go ask her to tell goldenfold not to kill us when she wakes up."
Ohh! Oh! Gross! Gross!
"Can you blame him? Come on, old man, little boy. Let's make an inter-generational sandwich."
What the hell? Why would Mr. Goldenfold's dream version of Mrs.
"Welcome to your nightmare, bitch! RAAAAAWWWRRR!"
Ooooooohhhhh! Holy crap!
"Aw! Oh, my God! He recognizes the other dogs on TV."
"Oh, man, oh, man, oh, man!"
Huh?
Ohhhh!
You will walk when it is time to walk.
"We're trying to incept me to get an ""A"" in math?"
"You can run, but you can't hide, bitch!"
But that's the opposite of what-
"Hey, you know what? You got a really good point there, Rick. Like, if the truth was that we could hide, it's not like he'd be sharing that information with us, you know? I-I-I think it's a good idea, Rick."
"Wow, you know what? I mean, it looks like we could have just hid this whole time. Boy, Rick, that was some good thinking."
You can run But you can't hide!
"Yeah, I know, I know. I shouldn't take my anger out on you or Scary Brandon. I love you, Melissa."
"Morty, this is perfect. After a little scary coitus, they should be fast asleep and then we'll incept him."
"Oh, uh, um ... ""Bitch."""
"Yeah, this is a bunch of bullcrap. Who cares what stupid pun you make when you kill someone? Why don't you let the poor guy say whatever he wants?"
"You don't need to say anything. We got you, dawg."
"If you guys ever need anything, just say the word."
What the hell?
"Oh, man, what's going on?"
This is why I choose to get C's.
- Dad! - Rick!
"Whoa, whoa, whoa. We're not going anywhere. This is my house. I'm not abandoning it."
Bad person. Bad.
"Mmm. Thank you, Fido. Rick! I thought you were dead!"
What?
But I-it's been like a whole year!
"Aw, man. I really liked this life. Well, at least I didn't really crap my pants."
"Aw, man, geez! Seriously?"
"Are these pills supposed to wake me up, or something?"
What?!
"Wow! A whole world populated by intelligent dogs. I wonder what it'll be like, Rick."
"You know, that's a real comforting idea, Rick."
"What do you know, Morty? What do you know?"
"Ahhh, well,  I remember feeling that way about a young lady named your mom, and that's not an urban dis, your mom was my Jessica. I remember the first time I saw her, I thought..."
"I beg your pardon, Rick, INAPPROPRIATE."
"My marriage is fine, thank you."
"Come on, Rick, don't talk about my parents like that."
"Yeah, I'm just going to...check on your mom."
"Hey, listen, Rick. You know how you said that, you know... love is a chemical and all that stuff from earlier?  Well, I was thinkn', you know, www... could you make some sort of chemical thing happen inside of Jessica's mind, you know, so where she falls in love with me and all that sort of thing, you know, like maybe make some sort of love potion or something?"
"YOU KNOW WHAT, NO RICK! I'M NOT GONNA HAND YOU THE SCREWDRIVER! Uh, I'm never gonna hand you anything ever again, Rick.  I'm always helping you with this and that and the other thing. Www...what about me, Rick? Www... why can't you just help me out once, once, for once?"
"You're growing up fast, Morty. You're growing into a real big thorn straight up into my ass!  Listen, this is called oxytocin. I extracted it from a vole. You know what a VOLE is, Morty, you know what a vole is?"
"Oh well, okay..."
Oww!
"Heck yeah! Thank you, Grandpa Rick!  Hey there's no dangers or anything or side effects, right?"
"Www.. what am I, a hack?! Go nuts, Morty, it's full proof."
A competent one.
Who cares about the  thing you guys are talking about? The whole point of freezing time is to stop giving a fuck. Put a shirt on your dumb dad and let's get this dumb universe rolling. Let's do this thing.
Our time is gonna be unstable? What does that even mean?
"Wait a minute, what?"
"Uh, did we ever put that mattress under Mr. Benson?"
"...A THING OR TWO ABOUT... wait, what? Was the house...? When we pulled up I could have sworn the house was completely trashed."
"Yeah, we missed you so much. Too much to hug you though."
Oh!
Phew...
"God, I feel terrible."
Yeah huh!
You shut up!
"Wait, what am I saying?"
"Whatever you're asking, the answer is I'm amazing. And away we go!"
"Whoa, ow, ow."
"Exactly, because you're being obstinate."
"Yeah, now keep those collars on so you don't break your weak ass time again."
You stole a time freezing crystal from testical monsters?
"You think I wanna be an omniscient immortal being transcending time and space my whole life? I got ambitions man, bringin' you guys in is my ticket up."
You really think I'm that stupid?
I cannot argue that.
You killed my gun!
What? What the hell are you doing?
"Oh, that was a close call. Oh yeah, do it Rick, do it right."
I don't know. I think like one sixty-fourth of my collars didn't work. It's hard to keep straight now that I have sixty-three other memories of everything.
"But I feel like one of the sixty-four Ricks like, sacrificed himself for me, maybe, I think."
"Doesn't feel so good, does it?"
"Jerry, get a job."
"Gross, what is that thing?"
"Ughhhh... belchflies towards front doorTurning back around and re-entering dining roomScoffsHovers over Jerry and fully shoves him into underside before flying away through open front door and into skyRuns to front doorFollow BethLooking into skyStill eating cerealUnscrewing and drinking from scotch flaskMorty waveskissing Beth's handHolding a suit in a dry cleaning bag* Your language has 'squanch,' in it a lot. Doesn't that become tedious and worn out like the Smurf thing?"
"What? I do, I squanch my family."
"Uhh, where?"
"Dad, what do you know about this?"
"Have you tried sending it launch codes? Mr. President, what America’s got is 70,000 megatons of KABOOM-BOOM! And I say we show it right up this floating head’s ass!"
Stand down. Everybody stand down! I’m the leader of these people and I’m unarmed. There’s no need for any more snake-makery.
Hey.
"I’ve seen enough of the galaxy to know that what we’ve got here is a Cromulon from the Cygnus-5 Expanse. So you can forget about nukes, and you can forget about math.  This head won’t go away until  Earth shows them it’s got a hit song."
"All right, all right. Thank you, Mr. Sanchez. Change of plan, people. Get me Pharrell, Randy Newman, Billy Corgan, and The-Dream.  The-Dream? He wrote “Umbrella” and “Single Ladies”? You people haven’t heard of The-Dream?"
Dear God.
Sanchez! Are you a musician?
"Rick, are you really a musician?"
Me!
"Giant head in the sky, please forgive all that we’ve done. We’re sorry for increased levels of emissions and our racism. And of course, the amber alerts I keep ignoring on my phone."
"Rick, I think we need to cut our losses. We get our family and portal out of here!"
"Oh man, ok, all right, um…"
"It’s our world’s best effort, that’s what."
"Don’t analyze it, Nathan. It’s working!"
Listen! The storm is stopping!
What the hell happened?
"WE ASKED THEM TO SHOW US WHAT THEY GOT. AND THEY DID. NOW WE’LL SEE WHICH OF THEM HAS GOT THE MOST. 24 HOURS, FIVE PLANETS, FIVE SONGS. BUT IN THE END, THERE CAN ONLY BE ONE. PLANET MUSIC! All participation is involuntary. Disqualified and losing planets are disintegrated by plasma ray."
Like we’re not already under enough pressure!
"Rick, Ice-T, could you guys take it less easy?! We’ve got six hours to come up with a song!"
"Well, can we at least go get our family? You know, so we can take them with-with-with us if we lose?"
"That’s planning for failure, Morty. Even dumber than regular planning.  Balls."
What?!
Stop saying it like it’s a thing! You made it up!
"Aw, damn. We’re out of original flavor Fig Newtons. I should get going anyway."
That’s it!
You lied! You lied about the charge! You were just being lazy! Get back! Sit down!
I’m going to go find Mom and Dad.
Nooooo!
"You appear to be dying. I will make efforts to prevent this, but can promise nothing."
"Shit. Over-developed, under-developed. Bad songs are bad songs."
"Ah, hell no, man. You do your thing, but I can’t afford to get my pride wrapped up in your shame. You know what I’m sayin’?"
"Pfff. I ain’t worried about no Earth blowin’ up, man."
"Yo, this is why."
"My story begins at the dawn of time in the far away realm of Alphabetrium. There, every being is a letter of the alphabet. But I was frozen and exiled to the cosmos by my elders as punishment for not caring enough about anything. Earth is just one of the many stops on my lifelong journey with no destination. So you better believe I don’t care if it blows up! Cause I’ll just be ice, floatin’ through space, like a comet!"
SHOW ME WHAT YOU GOT.
"Mr. President, if I’ve learned one thing today, it’s that sometimes, you have to not give a fuck!"
The heads are displeased!
"What do you say, Rick?"
I say…  Let’s do it!
Ohhhh yeahhhh!
Ohhhh yeahhhh!
Why didn’t he turn into a snake?
I have changed. I am ready to rejoin my brethren on Alphabetrium.
Woahh!
Why would you keep mutant bacteria in a pint of Cherry Garcia?
Not anymore.
You're overreacting!
Is he going to die?
"Go in the waiting room, Dad."
"Fine!  Excuse me. Coming through. What are you here for- Just kidding, I don't care. Well this won't do."
A sequel.
Eye-holes! Get them today! IKEA.
"I can't believe you're explaining alien cereal, we're worried about Jerry."
"Yes I will! That's right, assholes, take my penis, TAKE IT ALL! And tell Shrimply Pimples that when the galaxy came calling Jerry Smith from Earth didn't flinch!"
"Huh? Uh, no no no, I'm-I'm just looking at that lady getting coffee. What's up with her face? Is she a human or is she like Worf. You know Worf, from Star Trek, where he has the shit all over his face but he's just a human in a costume, you know?"
Whoa! Look! It's that lady with all that shit on her face like Worf from Star Trek! That was getting coffee! How did she get there!
Is that something we should be concerned about?
"Rick, who-who is Jan-Michael Vincent?"
Is it important that we know who Jan-Michael Vincent is in order to get this?
"This January, It's time to Mike down your Vincent's. Jan Quadrant Vincent 16."
"Excuse me, nurse, can you take my temperature? Because I think I have Jan Quadrant Vincent fever over here."
"Well, Jerry, what kind of wife would I be if I did anything to stand in your way?"
"Wow, Rick! That's -- That's one -- one heck of a story. I sure do wish I could have been there to see it happen."
"Dad, it's great to have you back, no matter where we are, but wouldn't you like to go home?"
"Yeah, but you just got out of prison. I mean, how much of a step up from that is --"
You got it.
"Man, I told the money bugs. I said, ""You know who this guy is, right? You want me to get intel out of the smartest mammal in the galaxy, you better give me a decent brainalyzer."
"Oh, I think you do. Eventually, you're either gonna relax your cerebellum."
Or the Series 9000 is going to turn it into mush.
Ooh!
"Oh, any particular ones? You want to see my first boner, or should we go straight to the moment I discovered interdimensional travel?"
"It's arousal. Yes, I'd like very much to visit the memory of you inventing your portal gun."
"Yeah, well, tough titties."
"If we stay here, you'll die, along with all your memories. If you take me where I want to go she'll be there, too, won't she?"
"Oh, that sounds cool. I can get what I want and you can say goodbye."
Where are we going?
To the day it all began and ended. The moment that changed everything.
"Rick, you're doing this bit while your brain is melting."
Is that--
When'd you make the leap to interdimensional travel?
"Whoa. I-Is that it, the portal gun?"
"Yeah! Thanks, Rick. I'll try to remember to shut off the brainalyzer. Actually, I think it shuts off automatically once your brain is liquid. Don't know, don't care. Pull me out.  Hey, pull me out! Can you hear me?"
Why not?
What are you talking about? This is a memory. Y-You can't alter details of a memory.
It's a trap! Abort! I'm still in his Shoney's! Repeat -- we never left his Shoney's!
"Mission accomplished, boys. Pull me out."
Grandpa Rick!
Rick!
"That's enough, Rick."
"You're a rogue Rick -- irrational, passionate. You love your grandkids. You came to rescue them."
Why not shoot through her?
What the fuck?
Because you love her!
I hate you!
"That's enough! Drop the gun, Rick!"
I'm not letting you let my sister die! Drop the gun!
Aww.
"Morty, you fucking idiot!"
"That was amazing, Morty. Oh, my God. Wow. Okay, let's wrap this-"
What?! What happened?
Can't we just portal home?
Not until I finish what I started. And that is how you get level-nine access without a password.
"So, what are you doing with level-nine access anyways?"
"Ooh, or -- or reprogram their military portals to disintegrate their entire space fleet?"
"Just each other, and I'll never let you go. And I'm so sorry I ever did this to us."
Please don't leave me again.
I was right. He turned himself in on purpose. It was all part of his plan!
"Um..okay. No. No, no, no. Foot down time."
"Beth, it's him or me!"
"Seems like you guys need some privacy. I'll, uh -- I'll be in the garage."
Jerry's going to spend some time divorced.
"Oh, God, Dad, that is not your burden to bear. I feel terrible that I misjudged you. This is gonna be good for Jerry."
"Geez! Are my parents seriously gonna get divorced? All right, Rick, I'm gonna go to my --"
"Okay, take it easy, Rick. T-T-That's dark."
"Oh, geez."
"Oh, fuck."
"Oh, man."
"Oh, man."
You're gonna deny it.
Oh.
What are you talking about?
Szechuan?
McNuggets?
What the hell?
"What are you talking about, Rick?"
What are you talking about?!
What is that?!
What are you talking about?!
Weird breed.
"Really? Like, go somewhere? Yeah, let's drop the kids off and go tie one on."
"So what are you thinking, like, Smokey's Tavern? Maybe Shoney's?"
"Yeah, either one. Either one."
"You'll never get away with this, Concerto."
"Oh, geez, Rick, I-I-I don't want to die!"
"Who? Who was that, Rick?"
"That, Morty, is why you don't go to therapy."
Then why aren't we killing them?!
"Oh, Rick! I-Is that the Vindibeacon? We're being called to assemble by the Vindicators!"
"Rick, the Vindicators only call when the universe itself is at stake! They're first line of defense against evil! They're the guardians of the unguarded!"
"I, Morty Smith, invoke my right to choose one in every ten Rick and Morty adventures.  Read 'em and weep."
"Yes!  Vindicator command ship, beacon received! We're doing Vindicators Twoooooooooo!"
"..and this time, he's out to end more than worlds. We have reason to believe his stronghold is located on..."
"...the Terraneus system. Once in range, Million Ants will scan for pheromone activity, which should lead us to the location of the base."
"Rick, you have something to add to the briefing?"
"Uh, yeah, just a few more design notes.  Um, this guy. The, uh... The, uh..."
"Right, Crocubot. So, you're half-cold, unfeeling reptile, half-also cold, equally-unfeeling machine."
"Noob-Noob, we're having a briefing!  If I can continue, Rick. I anticipate sophisticated security measures. I trust you can be of service there."
I wish he had the ability to check is attitude.
"Alan Rails, ladies and gentleman. After his parents' tragic death in a railroad accident, he gained the power to summon ghiost trains. It's not all bad, though. They were spared having to see their grown son wear a whistle!"
Happy hour.
"Did he say ""three for three""?"
Are you sure there's not just a picnic nearby.
"I guess he found his crowd. Pretty toothless stuff, guys."
"We weren't here ""last time"", remember? They did a whole Vindicators without us. A bunch of them got killed, too. They lost Lady Katana, Calypso, Diablo Verde..."
"This article says the reason we weren't involved was... ""personality conflicts""."
I... think the personality conflict might have been... you.
"Rick, since it's my adventure and all, could you do me a favor?"
"Rick, this really bums me out. It-It's embarrassing to find out these guys don't like us."
"Yeah, but not heroes."
"I'm calling them that, Rick! They're my heroes! Mine!"
Someone wake up Sanchez.
"Rick, you're up."
"Rick, we're taking fire from an automated turret. Can you bring it offline?"
Uh-huh.
RICK!
I could've just used a ghost train.
"Man, fuck you."
Get it yourself.
"Just focus on the mission, all right?"
"Well, he is the Worldender. The guy ends worlds. Kind of his thing."
I sense his life force is fading.
"Million Ants, ladies and gentleman! The ant colony with the power of two human eyes!"
He's right. This is far from over.
"Well, have fun with that. But Morty and I have to meet a comet girl, a monorail man, two assholes and a full alligator in, like, an hour."
"Check, check, One, two. Okay, is it recording? Good. Hello, Vindicators. Welcome to your reckoning, babyyyyyyyy!!"
"Rick? What's going on, buddy?"
"Obviously? You came here and defeated our arch-nemesis while so drunk, you don't remember doing it? That's something obvious to you?"
"Rick, is-is this a ""Saw"" thing? Are you seriously ""Saw""-ing the Vindicators?"
"If you break the rules, lose the game or try to leave, you will die. Like in  ""Sawwww""."
Screw this. I'm not playing his game. I'm gonna find us a way out of here.
Why are you acting like that's not you?!
Give me one good reason why I shouldn't crush your windpipe!
Because my epidermis is laced with a nanofiber defense mesh.
I told you not to invite this mummified motherfucker back!
The two of us?!  I hope you're proud of yourself!
"That's not the issue, Rick!"
"Crocubot, don't!"
"Oh, o-okay. This again?"
I-It's just something Rick starts talking about whenever he's blackout drunk.
"In a way that has no point! You just babble about defense budgets and the United Nations, and then you pass out!"
I have no stake in this.
"You guys hit the baskets. I'll disarm the drunkenly-improvised neutrino bomb. There's a 40% chance it's a dud, but y-you should still stay back."
"Too many, Rick! Too many!"
That's a three-pointer!
"You always put it in the weirdest place! Um, uh, over here, maybe?"
"Oh, I don't know. You managed to destroy just about everything today; the villains, the heroes, the lines between them, my childhood..."
"Yeah, it is. You know why, Rick? Because when you're an asshole, it doesn't matter how right you are, nobody wants to give you the satisfaction."
STOP!
Is that sarcasm?!  I don't want you slipping away then this is over! All of these deaths are on your hands!
All of them.
"Jesus! Okay, open to second opinions!"
What?
That is a... really specific guess.
I'll cover that bet. I get it.
"Well, Morty, I think you're making that smirky face because you're misinterpreting the moment. I am not being coy about some hidden love for you. I want to be really clear that, if anyone has a better guess, like, if I gave you an amulet last night, or..."
"You're fucking cool! And you're smart! And I bet we coulda hung out and shit! And I hope you get to be a full-fledged Vindicator! A-And d-do me a favor. Do-Don't let him know I... I got emotional. But you can tell him one thing. Tell him I said... Oh, fuck. Okay, I just shit myself. Okay, later."
Greater good?!
It's the galaxy's faith in the Vindicators that keeps the galaxy secure!
No doubt. Who do we make the check out to?
"Goodbye, my love."
"Let's give a huge thanks to Rick Sanchez for killing Worldender, putting this awesome party together, and for booking one of the hottest talents out there"
"Rick, Supernova's getting away!"
But.. she was trying to kill us!
